# Welcome  

With 20+ years in software quality, test strategy, and engineering leadership, I’ve helped teams across diverse industries build reliable, high-quality software. My experience spans hands-on test automation, infrastructure, performance engineering, and guiding teams through complex technical environments.  
Above all, I try to help people avoid getting bitten by retroactive spiders—and steer clear of becoming [Captain Hindsight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30mvxjcfCGI) as a result. 

## Areas of Focus  

- Test strategy & automation
- Test tooling
- CI/CD and TestOps  
- Performance & reliability testing  
- Infrastructure and cloud-based testing  
- Software quality processes  

## Let’s Connect  

I enjoy working on challenging software quality problems and exploring better ways to test and build resilient systems. If you're interested in discussing ideas or potential collaboration, feel free to connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miklosbagi/).
