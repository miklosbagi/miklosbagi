# Welcome  

With 20+ years in software quality, test strategy, and engineering leadership, I’ve helped teams across diverse industries build reliable, high-quality software. My experience spans hands-on test automation, infrastructure, performance engineering, and guiding teams through complex technical environments.  
Above all, I help tech leaders and teams avoid getting bitten by retroactive spiders—so they don’t become [Captain Hindsight](https://youtu.be/ulEImZvlVno).
