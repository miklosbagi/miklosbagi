## 👋 Welcome

I build software quality systems and processes that hold up under real world pressure — whether that’s mobile apps with millions of users, or microservices running on vessels in the middle of the ocean.

I’m currently a Lead Quality Engineer at Ninety Percent of Everything (90POE), working in maritime tech. My focus is where testing meets infrastructure: TestOps, resilience, and CI/CD pipelines that don’t flinch under pressure.

Over the years, I’ve led QA and test strategy for media giants (Disney, ABC News, ESPN, NatGeo, Marvel) to modern remote-first platforms. Whether it’s building fault-tolerant environments, simulating unstable networks, or writing tools that make teams faster and safer—I aim to spot issues before they become postmortems.

Above all, I help tech leaders and teams avoid getting bitten by retroactive spiders—so they don’t end up as [Captain Hindsight](https://youtu.be/ulEImZvlVno). 

### 🔧 What I work on

- Microservices testing (mocks, stubs, chaos simulations)
- Shift-left quality strategy & hands-on automation
- Test infrastructure embedded in CI/CD pipelines (TestOps)
- System resilience in high-latency, low-connectivity environments (think: open ocean)
- Custom tooling (e.g., VirusTotal integration for binary scans in CI)
- Daily stack: Go, gRPC, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS

### 🛰️ Recent roles:

- 90POE – Maritime systems QA leadership (2023–now)
- DMED / Disney – QA & productivity engineering across streaming apps, internal tools, and automation platforms (2011–2022)
- ABC News – Led QA for mobile coverage of the 2020 U.S. Elections
- DisneyLife / Disney+ prototype – QA strategy & hybrid internal/external test frameworks

With 20+ years in software quality, test strategy, and engineering leadership, I’ve helped teams across diverse industries build reliable, high-quality software. My experience spans hands-on test automation, infrastructure, performance engineering, and guiding teams through complex technical environments.  

### 🧪 I believe in:
- Automation that adds confidence—not just coverage
- Resilience as a mindset, not just a test suite
- Infrastructure that makes testing frictionless
- Collaboration over gatekeeping

### 🛠️ Outside of work:
- Self-hosted homelab (10GbE, Zigbee, MQTT, PKI, Home Assistant)
- Automating workflows and testing weird edge cases
- Always tinkering, always learning

If it breaks, I want to know how—and why—before users do.

### 🤝 Let’s Connect  

I enjoy working on challenging software quality problems and exploring better ways to test and build resilient systems. If you're interested in discussing ideas or potential collaboration, feel free to connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miklosbagi/).
